ROCker-Meth (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analyzER of DNA Methylation
data) tool consists of four main modules:

1. computation of Area Under the Curve (AUC) values from Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) Curve analysis of methylation levels (i.e., beta values) in
tumor versus normal samples; 

2. segmentation of AUC values by a tailored Heterogeneous Shifting Level Model
(HSLM);

3. estimation of the statistical significance of AUC segments by
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test on beta values of tumor versus normal samples;

4. identification of sample specific DMRs by Z-score statistics.
